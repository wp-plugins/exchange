Which version of PHP does this plugin work with?</p>
<p>PHP 5.2 is the minimum current requirement for WordPress. <br>
This plugin requires at least PHP version 5.2.1 due to having to decode JSON responses from the Open Source Exchange Rates API.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Exchange. Thanks.</p>
<p>If you value my work and the widget has been helpful to you, consider giving me a cup of coffee, and I will gladly continue working day and night to provide you with better support and new versions. Any kind of contribution would be highly appreciated. Thank you very much!
